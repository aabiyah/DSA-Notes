The Two Pointers technique is an efficient algorithm used primarily for finding pairs in a sorted array that meet certain criteria, such as summing to a specific value X.

**Typical Use Case**: Searching for a pair of elements in a sorted array whose sum equals a given target value X.

## Illustration Example:

1. Given an array A[] = {10, 20, 35, 50, 75, 80}, and target sum X = 70.
2. Start with pointers at the beginning (i = 0) and end (j = 5) of the array.
3. Adjust the pointers based on the sum:
  - If A[i] + A[j] > X, decrement j.
  - If A[i] + A[j] < X, increment i.
5. Continue adjusting until you find the pair that sums to X.

   
## Algorithm Explanation:

- Key Concept: Leverage the sorted nature of the array.
- Process:
1. Start with two pointers: i at the start (smallest element) and j at the end (largest element).
2. Sum the elements at the pointers: A[i] + A[j].
3. Adjust pointers based on the sum:
  - If the sum is less than X, increment i to increase the sum.
  - If the sum is greater than X, decrement j to decrease the sum.
6. Repeat: Until the pointers meet or you find the desired pair.

## Methods:

1. NaÃ¯ve Approach:
   
**Explanation**: Uses nested loops to check all possible pairs.

**Code Example**:
```
def isPairSum(A, N, X):
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if i == j:
                continue
            if A[i] + A[j] == X:
                return True
            if A[i] + A[j] > X:
                break
    return 0
```
**Time Complexity**: O(N^2) *(Quadratic)*
**Auxiliary Space**: O(1)

2. Two Pointers Technique:
   
**Explanation**: Utilizes two pointers to find the pair more efficiently.

**Code Example**:
```
def isPairSum(A: List[int], N: int, X: int) -> bool:
    i, j = 0, N - 1
    while i < j:
        if A[i] + A[j] == X:
            return True
        elif A[i] + A[j] < X:
            i += 1
        else:
            j -= 1
    return False
```
**Time Complexity**: O(NlogN) *due to sorting (if not already sorted)*
**Auxiliary Space**: O(1)


The Two Pointers technique optimizes search time, especially in sorted arrays.
It reduces the need for nested loops and offers a more direct approach to finding pairs.
The method is versatile and can be applied across various programming languages and problem types.
This technique is essential for problems that involve sorted data and require efficient pair searches.
